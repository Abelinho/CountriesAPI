For swagger: http://localhost:9099/swagger-ui/index.html

Suggestions: the application should have security. I did not add it as it was not specified. 
However I added the jwt code to abel-dev branch. Check that branch for it

The application should have a docker file too so that it can run as a container
on docker. This file was not added by me as it was not required by you
